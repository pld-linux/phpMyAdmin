- updated to 2.6.0-rc please note two things (please comment):
  1.) blowfish phrase is now required for cookie auth, pelase set it independently
  in /etc/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php (not sure if the package should contan a default phrase
  the good thing about that is: works out of the box, bad: insecure
  2.) PMAbsoluteUri should be set as well (at least here the autodetection mechanism failed),
  it is default in PLD for http://<yourwebdomain>/myadmin
  again not sure if this should be added in the config file by packager or not
